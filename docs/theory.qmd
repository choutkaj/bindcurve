## Logistic models

Logistic models are implemented in the traditional sigmoid form. This model could be used broadly for any dose-response curve, where x corresponds to dose and y corresponds to response. In the context of BindCurve, x will commonly correspond to the total concentration of the titrated ligand. By fixing the slope in these models to a constant value (e.g. 1 for activation and -1 for inhibition), this four-parameter model is reduced to a three-parameter model.

$\text{IC}_{50}$ is fitted using the following equation:

$$
y = ymin + (ymax - ymin) \frac{1}{1 + \left(\frac{\text{IC}_{50}}{x}\right)^{\text{slope}}}
$$

where x is the dose, usually the total concentration of the titrated ligand

$$
x = [L]_T
$$

Analogically, $\text{logIC}_{50}$ is fitted using:

$$
y = ymin + (ymax - ymin) \frac{1}{1 + 10^{\text{slope}(\text{logIC}_{50} - x)}}
$$

where x is log transformed dose

$$
x = \log([L]_T)
$$



## Exact polynomial models

BindCurve implements several exact models that allow for direct fitting of $K_d$ from both direct and competitive binding experiments, given some crucial information about the system is known. These models are based on the assumption that the observed binding curve could be related to the bound fraction of the labeled ligand. This quantity is denoted as $F_b^*$ and is defined as:

$$
F_b^* = \frac{[RL^*]}{[L^*]_T}
$$

where $[RL^*]$ is the concentration of the complex of receptor and labeled ligand, and $[L^*]_T$ is the total concentration of the labeled ligand.

### Direct binding

![](images/direct.svg){fig-alt="Direct binding." fig-align="center" width=20%}


In direct binding, the system is composed of receptor $R$ and labeled ligand $L^*$ which form complex $RL^*$. This binding equilibrium is described by a dissociation constant $K_d^*$. For such a system, $F_b^*$ could be related to the concentration of free receptor $[R]$ by the equation

$$
F_b^* = \frac{[RL^*]}{[L^*]_T} = \frac{[R]}{K_d^* + [R]}
$$

To allow for a proper description of the dependent variable, the general framework for direct binding is defined as

$$
y = ymin + (ymax - ymin) \frac{[R]}{K_d^* + [R]}
$$

## Model - Direct Binding, Simple
### Model A
### Model B


$$[R] = [R]_T$$



## Model - Direct Binding, Specific

Dissociation constant is defined as

$$
K_d^* = \frac{[R][L^*]}{[RL^*]}
$$


Conservation of mass requires that

$$ [L^* ]_T = [L^*] + [RL^*] $$

$$ [R]_T = [R] + [RL^*] $$

and thus

$$ [RL^*] = \frac{[R][L^*]_T}{K_d^* + [R]} $$

Quadratic Equation:

$$ [R]^2 + a[R] + b = 0 $$

where

$$ a = K_d^* + [L^* ]_T - [R]_T $$

$$ b = -K_d^* [R]_T $$

Using the quadratic formula, the positive root is

$$ [R] = \frac{-a + \sqrt{a^2 - 4b}}{2} $$

## Model - Direct Binding, Specific + Nonspecific

Dissociation constant is defined as

$$ K_d^* = \frac{[R][L^*]}{[RL^*]} $$

Conservation of mass requires that

$$ [L^* ]_T = [L^*] + [RL^*] + N^* [L^*] $$

$$ [R]_T = [R] + [RL^*] $$

and thus

$$ [RL^*] = \frac{[R][L^*]_T}{K_d^* (1 + N^*) + [R]} $$

Quadratic Equation:

$$ [R]^2 + a[R] + b = 0 $$

where

$$ a = K_d^* (1 + N^*) + [L^* ]_T - [R]_T $$

$$ b = -K_d^* [R]_T (1 + N^*) $$

Using the quadratic formula, the positive root is

$$ [R] = \frac{-a + \sqrt{a^2 - 4b}}{2} $$
